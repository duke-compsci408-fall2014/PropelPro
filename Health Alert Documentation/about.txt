HEALTH ALERT

ABOUT

HealthAlert allows users to monitor important vital statistics of their family and friends. Doing this is simple: connect your devices to your iPod or iPhone, put in the phone numbers of the family and friends you want to be notified when a health event occurs, and our app does the rest of the work!
